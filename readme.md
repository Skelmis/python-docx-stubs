Partial type stubs for [python-docx](https://github.com/python-openxml/python-docx).

This project is more to save myself some time and is not considered complete coverage.

Targeting Python 3.10 & python-docx==0.8.11

Install these with:
```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/Skelmis/python-docx-stubs.git
```

Then navigate to the directory in the Pycharm hierarchy and mark it as a "Source Root". Enjoy
